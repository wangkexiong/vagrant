# Ubuntu 18.04 switched from LightDM to GDM3.
# If gdm3 is used, there will be at least 2 xauth:
#   One for login and the other for X-Window.
# This can be verified by: `ps wwwwaux | grep auth`.
# Thus x11vnc service needs to open 2 ports. After login successfully, switch vnc connection.
# Connecting to the login screen with VNC while using GDM3 is currently not easy to use.
# The easiest way to get this VNC functionality back is to simply switch back from GDM3 to LightDM.
